# Raptor-House
School project for a fictive resturant

Everything that I have written is in the src folder. 
Everything else is for if you want to download and have a look at it yourself. 
It was made with npm React, and the way you start the project is by installing the nessecary node modules 
with npm install and then using the npm start command in your console

For this project there was also created an API so we could learn how to manipulate the data, backend, instead of frontend
